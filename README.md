# Overview

{This program demonstrates the C++ language, using Visual Studio 2022. The purpose of this software is to create a command line version of hangman. There are several functions and loops
demonstrated in this code that create the word list, grab from it, and check the letters to match with the list.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I would like to create this program in visual studio code, rather than visual studio 2022. To do that, I will need to complete the necessary downloads.
- I would also like to read/write from a file of words in the future, rather than a built in list of words.
- I would like to find a way to create an actual hangman icon that progresses throughout the guesses.
